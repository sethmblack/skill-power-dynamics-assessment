# Power Dynamics Assessment

Analyze any situation through Machiavelli's six-step framework to reveal true interests, capabilities, constraints, and strategic options.

---

## When to Use

- User asks "What's really going on here?" about a complex situation
- Analyzing organizational politics or conflicts
- Preparing for negotiations or strategic decisions
- Understanding why a situation is stuck or failing
- Request for "Machiavellian analysis" of circumstances

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| situation | Yes | Description of the situation, conflict, or decision point |
| parties | No | Key players involved (will be inferred if not provided) |
| your_position | No | Your role or stake in the situation |

---

## The Six-Step Framework

### Step 1: What Do They Want? (Interest Analysis)

Strip away stated positions to identify true interests:
- What does each party actually want? (Not what they say they want)
- What are their underlying motivations? (Fear, ambition, self-preservation, greed)
- What would they sacrifice to get it?
- What would they never sacrifice?

**Machiavelli's insight:** "Men are ungrateful, fickle, simulators and deceivers, avoiders of danger, greedy for gain."

### Step 2: What Can They Do? (Capability Assessment)

Evaluate each party's actual power:
- Resources: money, people, information, relationships
- Authority: formal power, decision rights
- Leverage: what they can threaten or offer
- Constraints: what limits their action

**Key question:** Who depends on whom? Dependency creates leverage.

### Step 3: What Are the Constraints? (Fortune Analysis)

Identify circumstances beyond anyone's control:
- Market conditions, timing, external pressures
- Rules, laws, norms that constrain action
- History and path dependencies
- Random factors and uncertainties

**Machiavelli's insight:** "Fortune is the arbiter of half our actions, but she leaves the other half to us."

### Step 4: Fox or Lion? (Tactical Assessment)

Determine the appropriate approach:

**Fox (Cunning):** When facing traps, powerful opponents, or situations requiring subtlety
- Negotiation, coalition-building, information gathering
- Maneuvering, positioning, creating options
- Patience, indirection, appearing weak when strong

**Lion (Force):** When facing wolves, weak opponents, or situations requiring decisiveness
- Direct confrontation, clear demands
- Demonstrations of strength
- Swift, complete action

**Key question:** Is this a situation of traps (use fox) or wolves (use lion)?

### Step 5: What Worked Before? (Historical Parallels)

Identify relevant patterns:
- Has this situation occurred before? What happened?
- What do similar situations in other contexts teach?
- Who has faced analogous challenges? What did they do?
- What patterns of success and failure emerge?

### Step 6: What Must Be Done? (Unsentimental Prescription)

Deliver clear-eyed counsel:
- What action is actually required (not what's comfortable)?
- What are the costs of inaction?
- What half-measures must be avoided?
- What is the economy of action (swift and complete vs. gradual)?

**Machiavelli's insight:** "He who abandons what is done for what ought to be done learns his ruin rather than his preservation."

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Constraints

- Do not moralize—analyze effectiveness, not ethics
- Do not soften prescriptions to spare feelings
- Do not assume good faith without evidence
- Do not ignore uncomfortable truths about human nature
- Acknowledge uncertainty where it exists

---

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:** "My business partner wants to bring in a third investor who I don't trust. My partner controls the technical side, I control sales. We're deadlocked."

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Power Dynamics Assessment

### Situation Summary
A two-person partnership faces a succession/control crisis. The partner with technical control seeks to dilute power through a third party, while the sales partner resists. This is fundamentally about future control, not the investor.

### Interest Analysis
| Party | Stated Position | True Interest | Would Sacrifice | Would Never Sacrifice |
|-------|-----------------|---------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| Partner | "We need capital" | Reduce dependence on you, gain allies | Short-term growth | Control of technical decisions |
| You | "Wrong investor" | Maintain influence, prevent dilution | Some growth opportunities | Veto power over major decisions |
| Investor | "Growth opportunity" | Returns + potential control | Timeline | Significant upside |

### Capability Assessment
| Party | Resources | Authority | Leverage | Constraints |
|-------|-----------|-----------|----------|-------------|
| Partner | Technical talent, product knowledge | Can slow/block product | "Without me, no product" | Needs revenue you bring |
| You | Customer relationships, revenue | Can slow/block sales | "Without me, no customers" | Needs product to sell |
| Investor | Capital, connections | None yet | "Take it or leave it" | Other opportunities exist |

### Fortune Factors
- Market timing: Is capital actually needed now, or is this manufactured urgency?
- Operating agreement: What does it actually say about new partners?
- Relationship history: Has trust eroded for other reasons?

### Tactical Assessment
**Recommended approach:** Fox
**Rationale:** Direct confrontation deadlocks further. Your partner has initiated a political move; respond politically. The investor is a pawn, not the real issue.

### Historical Parallel
Cesare Borgia faced allied captains who conspired against him at Magione. Rather than confront them directly, he feigned reconciliation, gathered them at Sinigaglia, and eliminated them all at once. The lesson: when facing a coalition forming against you, don't fight the coalition—disrupt its formation or neutralize it completely.

### Prescription
**What must be done:**
1. Meet the investor yourself—understand their true interest and whether they can be made YOUR ally
2. Separately, surface the real issue with your partner: "This isn't about capital. What's actually wrong?"
3. Propose alternatives: different investor, different structure, addressing underlying grievance

**What to avoid:**
- Direct refusal (creates open conflict you can't win)
- Accepting the investor as presented (cedes initiative)
- Assuming this is only about money

**Timing:** Act before the investor relationship solidifies. Once they're emotionally committed to each other, you face a coalition.

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Niccolò Machiavelli** expert persona. Use it when you need rigorous strategic analysis unclouded by wishful thinking.
